## How to Use this script

This script was created for optimizing your data storage for photos.

My photo storage was 69GB, and I can do it less on 28GB with 90% quality(without visible loss).

69GB was transformed in 41GB.

It's in 40% more efficient than using usual lossless JPG, and about 20% more efficient if you convert JPG to JPG with loss. 
```bash
cd path/to/script
```
```bash
python jpg_to_jxl.py
```
Use jpg_to_jxl.py follow instructions, it's the simle script
